Prerequisites
1. Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK:
  
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
 

2. Connect to Microsoft Graph:
 
   Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Device.Read.All"


Script to Export Devices

# Connect to Microsoft Graph
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Device.Read.All"

# Retrieve all devices
$devices = Get-MgDevice -All

# Select all attributes
$deviceAttributes = $devices | Select-Object *

# Export to CSV
$deviceAttributes | Export-Csv -Path "C:\Path\To\Your\ExportedDevices.csv" -NoTypeInformation

Write-Output "Devices exported successfully to C:\Path\To\Your\ExportedDevices.csv"


Explanation
1. Install the Microsoft Graph SDK: This command installs the necessary module to interact with Microsoft Graph.
2. Connect to Microsoft Graph: This command authenticates your session with the required permissions to read device data.
3. Retrieve all devices: The `Get-MgDevice -All` command fetches all devices from Entra ID.
4. Select all attributes: The `Select-Object *` command selects all attributes of the devices.
5. Export to CSV: The `Export-Csv` command exports the device data to a CSV file at the specified path.

Additional Notes
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions in Azure AD to read device data.
- Modify the path in the `Export-Csv` command to your desired export location.
