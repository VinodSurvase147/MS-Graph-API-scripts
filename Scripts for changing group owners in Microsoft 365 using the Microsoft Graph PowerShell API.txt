
Scripts for changing group owners in Microsoft 365 using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell API.

Prerequisites
1. Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module:
 
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser

2. Connect to Microsoft Graph:
  
   Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Group.ReadWrite.All"
 

Adding a Single Owner

To add a single owner to a Microsoft 365 group, use the `New-MgGroupOwnerByRef` cmdlet.


# Define the group ID and the user ID of the new owner
$GroupId = "your-group-id"
$UserId = "new-owner-user-id"

# Create the owner object
$Owner = @{
    "@odata.id" = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/$UserId"
}

# Add the owner to the group
New-MgGroupOwnerByRef -GroupId $GroupId -BodyParameter $Owner


Adding Multiple Owners
To add multiple owners, you can loop through a list of user IDs.


# Define the group ID and the list of user IDs
$GroupId = "your-group-id"
$UserIds = @("user-id-1", "user-id-2", "user-id-3")

# Loop through each user ID and add them as owners
foreach ($UserId in $UserIds) {
    $Owner = @{
        "@odata.id" = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/$UserId"
    }
    New-MgGroupOwnerByRef -GroupId $GroupId -BodyParameter $Owner
}


Bulk Update from CSV
To add owners in bulk from a CSV file, you can use the following script. Ensure your CSV file has a column named `UserId`.


# Define the group ID and the path to the CSV file
$GroupId = "your-group-id"
$CsvPath = "C:\Path\To\Owners.csv"

# Import the CSV file
$OwnersFromCSV = Import-Csv -Path $CsvPath

# Loop through each entry in the CSV and add them as owners
foreach ($Owner in $OwnersFromCSV) {
    $OwnerHash = @{
        "@odata.id" = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/$($Owner.UserId)"
    }
    New-MgGroupOwnerByRef -GroupId $GroupId -BodyParameter $OwnerHash
}


Verifying the Changes
To verify the newly added owners, you can use the `Get-MgGroupOwner` cmdlet.

# Get the owners of the group
Get-MgGroupOwner -GroupId $GroupId


These scripts should help you manage group ownership efficiently. If you have any specific questions or need further customization, feel free to ask!
