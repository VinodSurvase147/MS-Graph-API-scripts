

To create Microsoft 365 (M365) dynamic groups with basic membership rules using Microsoft Graph PowerShell, follow these steps:

1. Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module

Ensure you have the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module installed. If not, install it using:


Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser


2. Connect to Microsoft Graph

Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Group.ReadWrite.All"


3. Create a Dynamic Microsoft 365 Group

Use the `New-MgGroup` cmdlet to create a dynamic group. Define the group's properties, including the dynamic membership rule.

Example: Create a Dynamic Microsoft 365 Group for Users in the 'Sales' Department


$groupParams = @{
    DisplayName                    = "Sales Team"
    Description                    = "Group for Sales department employees"
    MailEnabled                    = $true
    MailNickname                   = "SalesTeam"
    SecurityEnabled                = $false
    GroupTypes                     = @("Unified", "DynamicMembership")
    MembershipRule                 = 'user.department -eq "Sales"'
    MembershipRuleProcessingState  = "On"
}

New-MgGroup -BodyParameter $groupParams


Explanation:

- `DisplayName`: The group's display name.
- `Description`: A brief description of the group.
- `MailEnabled`: Set to `$true` for Microsoft 365 groups to enable email.
- `MailNickname`: The group's email alias.
- `SecurityEnabled`: Set to `$false` for Microsoft 365 groups.
- `GroupTypes`: Includes `"Unified"` for Microsoft 365 groups and `"DynamicMembership"` to specify dynamic membership.
- `MembershipRule`: Defines the criteria for dynamic membership; in this case, users whose department is 'Sales'.
- `MembershipRuleProcessingState`: Set to `"On"` to enable processing of the membership rule.

4. Verify Group Creation

After running the script, verify the group's creation:


Get-MgGroup -Filter "DisplayName eq 'Sales Team'"


Additional Considerations:

- Licensing: Ensure your tenant has the necessary licenses for dynamic groups. Microsoft Entra ID P1 licenses are required for dynamic membership features. 
- Permissions: The `Group.ReadWrite.All` permission is necessary to create groups.
- Dynamic Membership Rules: Craft membership rules based on user properties such as department, job title, or other attributes. 

For more detailed information on creating groups with Microsoft Graph PowerShell, refer to the official documentation. 

By following these steps, you can create dynamic Microsoft 365 groups tailored to your organization's needs.
